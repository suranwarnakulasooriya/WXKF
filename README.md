# WXKF
A (for now terminal based) program to track student attendance. Written for a (I guess) private entity.

## Installation ##
First make sure [Python3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) is installed, then install the following dependencies.
```
pip install sys
pip install datetime
pip install random
pip install pandas # this should be the only dependency not automatically installed with Python
```
Then, clone this repository.
```
git clone --branch production https://github.com/suranwarnakulasooriya/WXKF
```
You can put this in the command line if you have `git` installed or you can download from this page. Make sure to download from the `production` branch. A folder named "WXKF" will be created. Navigate to that folder in the command line and run the program.
```
python3 WXKF_Databse.py
```
The program for now runs entirely in the terminal and there is no need to open any other files in the WXKF directory. The `man` command should tell you everything you need to know to use the program.
